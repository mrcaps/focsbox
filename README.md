focsbox
=======

A write-only student assignment dropbox. I was the NINJA (TA) for Foundations of Computer Science, Spring 2009, at Olin College. The class needed a dropbox for submitting assignments; I wrote focsbox to fill that role.

It's a webapp driven by a small php backend, with AJAX file uploading and listing. It also has a small management backend that lists which students have submitted files.

See the [project page](http://www.mrcaps.com/#proj/sel/Focsbox/) for this same description and a demo.
